click step 1, install setup
click step 2, let cmd finish
open songs.txt and add song name / link (add one every line)(don't forget to remove the example.com)
then go to search.py, if any song not downloaded, will be stored in nodownload.txt (please make sure you saved these links as executing another search will delete the old nodownload.txt)
